# Dashboard

The dashboard couchapp gives you a way to make a site out of a bunch of couchapps.



## The Garden Project

An open garden, opposite of a [Walled Garden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_(technology\) ), is a place for couchapp developers to distribute couchapps.
The name also pays tribute to the [Garden](https://couchapp.org/page/garden) project by J Chris Anderson.
